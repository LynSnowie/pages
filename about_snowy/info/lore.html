                        <h2>Snowy's Lore</h2>
                        <h3 style="padding: 10px;">NOTICE:</h3>
                        <h3 style="padding: 10px;">Most of this is just for my character, and not myself.</h3>
                        <h3 style="padding: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px">MOST of the information here is true about me. Sample ADHD, Mood and Music, Meowing Habit, and possibly others.</h3>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Snowy’s origins are wrapped in mystery, as elusive as the stars themselves. Though it's clear they’ve been part of the Furry Fandom for some time, not even Snowy knows when they first became involved. This secret adds to the air of intrigue that surrounds their life, especially with their preference to go by names like "Snow," "Snowy," or "Lyn Snow," avoiding their birth name altogether.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">From an early age, Snowy’s life has been shaped by ADHD, which became a defining part of their personality by 2016. They’re a bundle of energy, known for being fluffy and cute, though no one knows when this cuteness emerged—it just always was. Snowy is introverted and often prefers to be alone, both in person and in games, though they don't like feeling completely isolated—just away from overwhelming groups.</p>

                        <!-- <p style="padding: 20px">Despite their fluffy, adorable appearance, Snowy hides much more beneath the surface. Most of Snowy’s injuries and scars—including self-inflicted ones—are concealed by their fluff. Depending on the direction the fluff is stroked, these hidden wounds might become visible for a moment, revealing a deeper side of Snowy’s struggle with self-harm. However, one injury remains visible at all times: the first bite from Cone, a mark that Snowy never tries to hide. This bite, given out of love, zombified Snowy, and they don’t complain about it at all—in fact, they embrace it.</p> -->

                        <p style="padding: 20px">By 2021, Snowy became more reclusive, struggling with depression and internal battles they'd rather not fully share. They keep much of their pain inside, believing that no one truly cares about their struggles—until their emotions, particularly anger, bubble to the surface. "Nobody cares about your mental health until it turns into anger. Then everyone sees you as the problem," they often say.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Snowy hides their true feelings, lying about being "okay" to those they don’t trust as much as Cone, their partner. Strangely enough, they even sometimes lie to the people they do trust—Cone, friends like Fox and Derp—even if they don’t fully understand why. They may say they’re fine, but inside, the struggles are often overwhelming. For friends and acquaintances, Snowy can be convincing with a forced smile, but Cone always sees through it.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Snowy is terrified of losing anyone close to them, especially Cone, and these fears fuel Snowy's quiet, withdrawn moments during depressive or suicidal episodes. During these episodes, Snowy may try to isolate themselves completely, retreating to quiet places. However, sometimes they are unable to hide, and those around them witness their emotional breakdowns. In those moments, the vulnerability Snowy usually tries to keep hidden becomes painfully clear.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px">Episodes and Emotional Turmoil</h3>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">On September 25th, 2024, Snowy created something that would spiral them into a deep emotional crisis—drawing Cone in a maid outfit, something that made Snowy deeply uncomfortable. This act triggered two simultaneous episodes: a depressive episode and a suicidal one. For several days, Snowy isolated themselves, grappling with intense suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Though Snowy continued to tell friends like Cone and Derp that they were fine, the truth was far from it. Cone and Snowy’s friends sensed something was wrong and grew increasingly worried, having already been concerned about Snowy’s mental health even before these episodes began.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px">Mood and Music</h3>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">Snowy has a deep connection to music and relates to certain songs depending on their mood. When sad or overwhelmed, Snowy might play songs that match their emotional state, such as "I'm Done" by Robert Grace during suicidal episodes. Certain lines from the song resonate deeply, amplifying the pain Snowy already feels—pain they tend to embrace rather than avoid during these dark moments. Yet, even when not in a specific emotional state, Snowy can relate to songs as though their emotions are always simmering beneath the surface, waiting to be brought out by the right melody.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">2024 marked a pivotal year in Snowy’s life. A false accusation from Lynn (Lolie) of cheating on Cone shook Snowy's trust in people and worsened their mental health struggles. Since then, suicidal thoughts have haunted them, though they refuse to talk about it openly, as doing so "brings it back, if you understand." Snowy also finds peace through what they consider their "therapy," which can range from spending time alone, away from everyone, to finding comfort in Cone’s love. They alternate between these two forms of peace depending on their mood and emotional state.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Snowy’s relationship with pain is complicated. Whether it’s self-inflicted harm or something as simple as bites from Cone—whether out of love or otherwise—Snowy often finds these moments of pain grounding, helping them feel something real when emotions become too overwhelming.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px">Appearance and Tail:</h3>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">Snowy's appearance is characterized by his snow-white fur, which adds to his fluffy, adorable charm. His tail is particularly fluffy, hiding most of the scars and self-harm injuries underneath, making them invisible unless someone knows exactly where to look or brushes against the fluff in a specific direction. One injury, however, remains visible at all times—a bite from Cone. Snowy never hides this mark, as it holds significance to their relationship. This bite was also how Snowy became zombified, something he doesn’t complain about or try to conceal.</p>

                        <!-- <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px">Fluff and Scars</h3>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">Snowy’s body hides many secrets beneath its white fluff. While their tail and coat are soft and inviting to the touch, hidden underneath are the scars and injuries, some self-inflicted, that Snowy carries. The fluff conceals most of them, revealing them only when stroked a certain way. However, one mark will always remain visible—the bite from Cone, the mark that zombified Snowy. This scar is something Snowy never hides, wearing it like a badge of their connection to Cone.</p> -->

                        <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px">Relationship with Cone</h3>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">Snowy’s love for Cone blossomed in 2024, marking the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Though shy and unable to openly flirt with Cone, their relationship is filled with deep affection. Sometimes they’ll nervously say things like, "You own me :3" or "I give you my full permission to do whatever you want to me," though these moments are rare due to Snowy's shy nature. Cone’s physical gestures—like pats, boops, and hugs—bring Snowy comfort and grounding, especially during moments of emotional turmoil.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Despite these hardships, Snowy’s silly and chaotic side still shines through. Known for making goofy statements like, "If I eat a glow stick, will I glow? :3," they love foxes (mysteriously), snow, and their giant Calico cat plushie, which they cuddle while sleeping. Snowy finds joy in creating chaos but always respects boundaries, especially Cone's.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px">Meowing Habit</h3>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">Snowy has also carried an old habit of meowing, often catching themselves doing it unconsciously. While their friends find it endearing, Snowy still meows from time to time, a small reminder of their playful yet complex nature.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Though shy about flirting, Snowy expresses their love for Cone in other ways. They frequently tell Cone, "Your love is more than money could ever buy," or "You mean the world to me <3." Snowy may not always find the right words to express how much Cone means to them, but their actions speak volumes.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 20px">Though Snowy struggles with depression, ADHD, and anger issues, they continue to find their way in the world with Cone by their side, believing that Cone's love and support give them the strength to face whatever comes next.</p>
