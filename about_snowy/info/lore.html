                            Snowy's origins are wrapped in mystery, as elusive as the stars themselves. Though they have been part of the Furry Fandom for some time, even Snowy doesn’t know when they first got involved. This adds to their air of intrigue, especially since they prefer to go by "Snow," "Snowy," or "Lyn Snow," avoiding their birth name altogether. Snowy's love for cats has always been a core part of their identity—cats are their quiet companions, and Snowy finds joy in their calming presence.
                        </p>

                            <!-- From an early age, Snowy's life was shaped by ADHD. They are known for being fluffy, cute, and full of energy, though no one is quite sure when this cuteness first emerged—it’s just always been a part of who they are. Snowy is introverted and shy, often preferring solitude in both real life and gaming. They enjoy being alone but dislike complete isolation, simply seeking an escape from overwhelming crowds. -->
                            From an early age, Snowy's life was shaped by ADHD. They are known for being fluffy, cute, and full of energy, though no one is quite sure when this cuteness first emerged—it’s just always been a part of who they are. Snowy is introverted and shy, often preferring solitude in both real life and gaming. While they enjoy being alone, they dislike complete isolation, seeking an escape from overwhelming crowds. Their love of technology and computers provides both a creative outlet and a comforting space, where Snowy can dive into the world of programming and tech, finding joy in solving complex problems and building new things.
                        </p>

                            Snowy identifies as aroace (aromantic and asexual), which shapes how they view relationships and connections with others. This part of their identity means they value deep, meaningful friendships and companionship over traditional romance. Snowy doesn't feel romantic attraction but expresses love and affection in their own unique ways, especially through actions rather than words. Their relationships are rooted in mutual trust and respect, allowing them to connect deeply with people like Cone, their closest friend.

                            Snowy has struggled with depression since 2021, facing internal battles they rarely share openly. They often feel like no one truly cares about their mental health struggles—until emotions, particularly anger, bubble to the surface. Snowy is known to say, "Nobody cares about your mental health until it turns into anger. Then everyone sees you as the problem."

                            <br><br>During depressive or suicidal episodes, Snowy may express thoughts such as:

                            <br><br>"Who would really care if I was gone..."
                            "I'm ruining everything..."
                            "Wouldn't it be funny if this was the last time you'd hear from me..."
                            "One day, you'll never see me again."
                            "It's all my fault."
                            "I deserve this pain..."
                            "My name is better on a gravestone."
                            "A bullet would look good in my head."
                            <br>These phrases reflect the deep emotional pain Snowy feels in these moments. They are a cry for help, but Snowy often struggles to reach out to others for support, leaving them trapped in their own mind.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Emotional Vulnerability and Trust Issues -->

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            Though Snowy tries to keep their feelings hidden, even from close friends like Cone, Fox, and Derp, there are moments when their pain becomes too much to bear. During depressive or suicidal episodes, they may isolate themselves, retreating to quiet places, where their love of cats and quiet hobbies like tinkering with technology help them find peace. While they are convincing with a forced smile around acquaintances, Cone always sees through their facade. The fear of losing anyone close—especially Cone—drives Snowy’s deep-seated emotional turmoil.

                            <br><br>If asked whether they are "okay," Snowy will often respond with "Yes, I'm okay..." However, this can carry a deeper meaning:

                            <br><br>O: Overthinking again
                            K: Killed by sadness or depression
                            A: Attacked by anxiety
                            Y: Yes, I'm tired
                            <br>At times, Snowy may instead respond with, "No... but who cares?"—a haunting reflection of their internal struggles and emotional distance.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Personal Boundaries -->

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            While Snowy is affectionate with those they trust, they are particular about personal space. Snowy prefers people other than Cone to ask before doing anything that involves touching their tail, body, or nose. This includes head pats, boops, hugs, or petting. With Cone, these gestures bring comfort and grounding, but with others, Snowy values the respect of being asked first. Snowy appreciates physical affection but prefers to keep it within comfortable boundaries unless explicitly invited.

                            <br><br>Snowy also dislikes being picked up without permission and would prefer if people asked first. This boundary is part of their need to feel in control of their space and body.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            On September 25th, 2024, Snowy created something that spiraled them into an emotional crisis—drawing Cone in a maid outfit. This act triggered both a depressive and suicidal episode. Though they continued to tell their friends, including Cone and Derp, that they were fine, the truth was far from it. For several days, Snowy isolated themselves, grappling with intense suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Their friends grew increasingly worried, as they had already been concerned about Snowy's mental health.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Mood and Music -->

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            Snowy has a deep connection to music, which often reflects their emotional state. When overwhelmed, they might play songs that mirror their inner turmoil, such as "I'm Done" by Robert Grace during suicidal episodes. Certain lines resonate deeply with them, amplifying the pain they feel. Even when not in a specific mood, Snowy connects with songs that seem to speak to emotions simmering just beneath the surface.
                        </p>

                            Snowy has a complicated relationship with pain. Whether it’s self-inflicted harm or something as simple as bites from Cone—whether out of love or otherwise—Snowy often finds these moments grounding, helping them feel something real when emotions become too overwhelming.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Appearance and Tail -->

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            Snowy's body hides many secrets beneath its snow-white fluff. While their tail and coat are soft and inviting, hidden underneath are scars and injuries, some self-inflicted. The fluff conceals most of these marks, revealing them only when stroked in a certain way. However, one mark remains visible at all times—the first bite from Cone, the mark that zombified Snowy. This scar is something they wear like a badge of their connection to Cone.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            Snowy’s love for Cone blossomed in 2024, marking the start of a beautiful relationship. Though shy and unable to openly flirt, their relationship is full of deep affection. Sometimes they nervously say things like, "You own me :3" or "I give you my full permission to do whatever you want to me," though these moments are rare due to Snowy's reserved nature. Cone’s physical gestures—pats, boops, and hugs—bring Snowy comfort and grounding, especially during moments of emotional turmoil.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 35px">
                            Despite their struggles, Snowy’s silly and chaotic side often shines through. They are known for making playful statements like, "If I eat a glow stick, will I glow? :3," and are fond of foxes, snow, and their giant Calico cat plushie, which they cuddle while sleeping. Snowy loves creating harmless chaos, always respecting boundaries—especially Cone’s. Their playful nature also includes a deep love for all things related to computers and technology. Snowy enjoys building, repairing, and coding, finding joy in understanding how machines and systems work.

                            Snowy has an old habit of meowing, often catching themselves doing it unconsciously. While their friends find it endearing, Snowy still meows from time to time, a reminder of their playful yet complex nature.

                            In 2024, Snowy entered a femboy phase, which started as part of a playful bet with Cone. Snowy quickly embraced this side of themselves, finding happiness in the change. One of their favorite aspects of this phase is wearing purple thigh-highs, which have become a daily part of their wardrobe.

                            Snowy’s hearing can often go in and out—sometimes they may go deaf for a few moments, a phenomenon that happens at random intervals. This temporary deafness is an additional sensory quirk that adds to their complex experiences with ADHD and other sensory sensitivities.

                            Though shy about flirting, Snowy expresses their love for Cone in other ways. They often say things like, "Your love is more than money could ever buy," or "You mean the world to me <3." Snowy may not always find the words to fully express their feelings, but their actions speak louder than words.

                            <br><br>Despite their depression, ADHD, and emotional struggles, Snowy continues to find their way in the world with Cone by their side, believing that Cone’s love and support give them the strength to face whatever comes next. Snowy also finds solace in their deep love for technology and cats, which help ground them in moments of stress and provide joy in an often chaotic world.
